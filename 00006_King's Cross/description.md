Now it's your turn to create a **program** which, beginning with the head in the center, draws a “cross” like the one below. At the end, the head must be where it started, in the middle.

In this exercise we won't help you, but think which procedure of the ones you've already created before, may be useful to define your strategy. We've already added all of them to the Library, in order for you to use them without defining them.
