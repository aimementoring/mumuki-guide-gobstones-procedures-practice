We've already learnt several things. Now it's time to practice! :muscle:

Many of the following exercises are quite complicated, and you will need to define some **procedures** in order to solve them. Our advice is the following: think the **strategy** you will use and only then start programming. 

_But, how do I think the strategy?_ :scream:

Here you have some tips:

* try dividing the problem in other **smaller problems**. Quoting Machiavelli: ["Divide and conquer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithm) 
* think which parts of your problem are **repeated**, and create procedures you can use more than once;
* have always in mind the **initial position of the head** and choose properly where it will be once your procedure is executed;
* **a sheet of paper and a pencil may be useful!** :memo: Two minutes thinking over the problem in a sheet of paper, may save you from many hours of trying solutions that end up nowhere (we tell you this from experience, we go through the sameâ€¦)
