> Write a procedure `DropAtADistance3` which takes a _color_ and a _direction_, and drops a stone of such color, 3 places in the indicated direction, beginning from the initial cell (it doesn't matter which it is).

For example, if we executed `DropAtADistance3(Red, North)`, beginning from the origin, we would see this final board:

<gs-board>
  GBB/1.0
    size 4 4
    cell 0 3 Rojo 1
    head 0 3
</gs-board>
