> Write a procedure `DrawMulticoloredLine4` which draws a **multicolored line** of four cells to the _East_:

<gs-board>
 GBB/1.0
  size 5 2
  cell 0 1 Azul 1 Rojo 1 Verde 1 Negro 1
  cell 1 1 Azul 1 Rojo 1 Verde 1 Negro 1
  cell 2 1 Azul 1 Rojo 1 Verde 1 Negro 1
  cell 3 1 Azul 1 Rojo 1 Verde 1 Negro 1
  head 0 1 
</gs-board>

As you can see in the image, every cell must have **one stone of every color** (one red, one black, one green and one blue). In addition, at the end **the head must be in the initial cell**. 

Don't forget you can use procedures to divide your problem in smaller ones!
