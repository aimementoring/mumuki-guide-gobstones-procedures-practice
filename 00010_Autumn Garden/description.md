Autumn has arrived and uncle John has come up with the idea of building a garden in the terraceâ€¦ again.
Since he knows you are fond of programming, he asked you to create a **program** in Gobstones that helps him design his new garden, according to the following conditions:

* every **flowerpot** is a 2x2 square (meaning that its size is 4 cells);
* as he has doubts about the size of the garden, the program has to work for any big board;
* there must be a flowerpot in every corner of the garden and each one must be of a different color.

As you already know, the uncle is a little sensitive, so you have to respect the order of the color he chose.
Here you have an example of the garden we imagine, supposing it is 5 cells wide and 5 long.
